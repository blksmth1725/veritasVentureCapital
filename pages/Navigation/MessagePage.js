          Veritas Venture Capital has been delivering sustainable
          profit growth while building a solid business foundation
          amidst a challenging venture capital environment. My mission
          is to extend this trajectory into the future and turn
          Veritas Venture Capital into one of the first decentralized
          autonomous venture capital companies (DAVCC) running their
          investments on the blockchain. We continue to face new
          challenges in our investment environment as the pace and
          scale of Regulation A+ investments are unprecedented. In
          order to overcome these challenges, Veritas Venture Capital
          has undergone an organizational transformation that includes
          initiatives such as increased global investments and
          restructuring sector portfolios to include blockchain
          investments, cryptocurrencies, and biopharmaceuticals. These
          improvements will enable us to become faster at identifying
          and addressing shifts in the landscape. But there is more to
          be done, and we remain fully committed to strengthening our
          capabilities and to further evolving the organization going
          forward. In addition, improved diversity among the team has
          expanded our investment horizons. However, simply employing
          diverse talent alone is not enough to energize an
          organization. Nothing will change unless you have the right
          culture conducive to everyone being able to bring their full
          selves to work. Creating that environment is the
          responsibility of me and the rest of the management team. We
          have to adapt to provide the right products, services and
          information according to the markets current situation. We
          have to deliver all of this in a way that gets us the best
          possible investment results in the proper sectors. Only when
          these three pillars align with the companyâ€™s goals, do we
          achieve the investment goals we are aiming for. Some people
          take a negative view towards the future of financial
          institutions and in particular venture capitalism. I am
          confident the future holds boundless opportunities for the
          Regulation A+ sector and its investment potential. As we
          move forward towards this new future, Veritas Venture
          Capital will work hard to realize sustainable growth for the
          firm and society.
