        Our mission is to serve the world’s most extraordinary
        companies and extraordinary people who are building tomorrow’s
        companies today. We have global reach, with a presence and
        access to resources in Silicon Valley, China, Canada,
        Columbia, Australia, India, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Our
        broad global footprint enables our portfolio companies to
        better understand future growth opportunities and expand
        internationally. Of more than the 30 companies we have one
        hundred percent owned or partnered with since our founding, a
        third have either IPO’d or been acquired. And we have
        celebrated at least one IPO a year since our inception.
